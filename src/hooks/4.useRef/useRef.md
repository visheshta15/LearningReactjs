# UseRef
useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.

`const ref = useRef(initialValue)`

# Parameters 
`initialValue`: The value you want the ref objectâ€™s current property to be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.

# Returns 
useRef returns an `object with a single property`:

`current`: Initially, itâ€™s set to the initialValue you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property.

On the `next renders`, `useRef will return the same object.`

# Caveats/limitation
1. When you `change` the `ref.current property`, React does `not re-render` your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.
2. You can mutate the ref.current property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldnâ€™t mutate that object

# Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render
This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesnâ€™t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its current property:

function handleStartClick() {
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    // ...
  }, 1000);
  intervalRef.current = intervalId;
}

Later, you can read that interval ID from the ref

function handleStopClick() {
  const intervalId = intervalRef.current;
  clearInterval(intervalId);
}

# By using a ref, you ensure that:

1. You can `store information between re-renders` (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).

2. Changing it `does not trigger a re-render` (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead.

3. The` information is local` to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).

# Do not write or read ref.current during rendering.
React expects that the body of your component behaves like a pure function:
1. If the inputs (props, state, and context) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.
2. Calling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.
Reading or writing a `ref during rendering breaks these expectations`.

function MyComponent() {
  // ...
  // ðŸš© Don't write a ref during rendering
  myRef.current = 123;
  // ...
  // ðŸš© Don't read a ref during rendering
  return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>;
}

`You can read or write refs from event handlers or effects instead.`
function MyComponent() {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    // âœ… You can read or write refs in effects
    myRef.current = 123;
  });
  // ...
  function handleClick() {
    // âœ… You can read or write refs in event handlers
    doSomething(myOtherRef.current);
  }
  // ...
}

`If you have to read or write` something `during rendering`, `use state instead`.
When you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features weâ€™re adding to React will rely on these expectations

--> `React will set the current property back to null when the node is removed from the screen.`
